Elegant and impressively long, it concludes with a light kiss of toast.",92,22.0,Washington,Ardenvoir 2007 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sémillon,Ardenvoir,white
57829,US,"This barrel-fermented Sémillon deftly mixes smoky toast with rich and deep fruit flavors of melon and grapefruit. Exceptionally concentrated and full-bodied, it carries forward into this new vintage the well-established style of Ardenvoir's unique take on Washington Sémillon.",92,22.0,Washington,Ardenvoir 2009 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sémillon,Ardenvoir,white
126310,Australia,"Scents of wet stone, paraffin and citrus ease into flavors of lemon, melon and tea on the palate. This is light in body and silky in feel, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink it now or age it up to 10 years, maybe even longer.",92,24.0,New South Wales,Silkman 2015 Semillon (Hunter Valley),Sémillon,Silkman,white
105193,US,"This is just about perfect Sémillon— the gorgeous fruit has more flesh and breadth with flavors suggesting ripe fig, melon and citrus. The use of oak is judicious and thoughtful; it adds grace notes without dominating. You can't help but wonder why this grape remains such a novelty (except, ironically, at Novelty Hill!). It's seductive, delicious and unique.",92,16.0,Washington,Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sémillon,Novelty Hill,white
51966,US,"The winery holds back its wines to good effect. There's no sign of fatigue here, just well-integrated complex meaty flavors. It's dusky and dark, with aromas of smoke, tobacco and espresso. Flavors include all of the above around black fruits and slightly gritty tannins. It's dense and delicious and ready to drink.",93,28.0,Oregon,Dominio IV 2012 Three Sleeps Vineyard Sketches of Spain Tempranillo (Columbia Gorge (OR)),Tempranillo,Dominio IV,red
113880,Spain,"Crisp, toasty oak and spice aromas are currently outranking this wine's berry-fruit components...but only for now. In five or more years, this will be less oaky and more complex. At this point in time, look for a sinewy, tight, almost jagged palate with toasty, robust flavors of plum and berry, dry spices and mixed herbs along with firm tannins. A long, balanced finish bodes well for the future. Drink through 2030.",93,27.0,Northern Spain,Sierra Cantabria 2010 Reserva  (Rioja),Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria,red
88439,US,"This is the winery's first commercial release of this varietal, all aged in neutral French oak. It offers nuanced aromas of spice, tobacco, vanilla and savory notes that are followed by plentiful, palate-coating red and blue-fruit flavors that extend out through a long, fruit and spice-filled finish. Firm tannins provide the structure. It needs time still but possesses a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore.",93,28.0,Washington,Waters 2012 Stone Tree Tempranillo (Wahluke Slope),Tempranillo,Waters,red
37020,US,"Bokisch has made a Tempranillo that's relatively light in body, bursting with an earthy tobacco tone, with a backbone of leather. The palate feels velvety, with soft but structured tannins, bearing black cherry and dark chocolate flavors. This has to be one of California's best Tempranillos.",93,21.0,California,Bokisch 2010 Tempranillo (Lodi),Tempranillo,Bokisch,red
108701,Spain,"Direct and woody on the nose, with aromas of graphite and vanilla, this opens in fine form. A tight, pure palate deftly blends weight, fine acidity and chewy tannins, while the flavor profile is earthy and blackened by charred oak, with blackberry fruit and savory, peppery spice notes. This is meaty, savory and beefy on the finish. Drink through 2021.",92,27.0,Northern Spain,Lecco 2011 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),Tempranillo,Lecco,red
100677,US,"While crisp and bracing due to tart apricot and green apple flavors, this wine deepens on the palate as compelling white raspberry, white peach and subtle floral, spicy notes unfold. Markus Niggli added 5% North Carolina-grown Traminette, making it an interesting and seriously delicious bottle to enjoy over a seafood lunch or as an apéritif.",92,22.0,California,Markus Wine Co 2016 Insieme Torrontés (Lodi),Torrontés,Markus Wine Co,white

116741,Argentina,"Tropical fruit aromas come with notes of bath soap and white-flower blossom. This is easygoing and healthy on the palate, with just enough snappy acidity.

52776,US,"Uvaggio is making a serious case for Lodi Vermentino. This bottling is compelling: savory with herb and green olive notes, and yet freshly fruity and delicate, well integrated and plenty acidic to stand up to a wide range of food, even given its modest 11% alcohol level. A stunner that'll keep you thinking, and asking for more.",93,14.0,California,Uvaggio 2009 Vermentino (Lodi),Vermentino,Uvaggio,white

6267,US,"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard. Deeply concentrated, complex and creamy, it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits, honey and butterscotch, yet remains lifted by defining acidity.",94,18.0,Washington,Stottle 2011 Lucille Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley),Viognier,Stottle,white

6346,US,"Quite light in color, especially for the alcohol level, this wine offers dried red cherries, hibiscus, rose petals, pencil shavings and a touch of hot asphalt on the spicy and fun nose.

The vineyard is in Calistoga, and the warmth has coaxed out intricate flavors of wild red and black berries and cherries, mocha, herbs and spices, with a distinct black pepper note. The tannins are thick, but very fine.
